			<h2 class="intro">a set of guidelines or rules that determine a
				course of action</h2><br>
			<p>A policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide
				decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of
				intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are
				generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.</p>
			<p>Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision
				making. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually
				assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the
				relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often
				hard to test objectively, e.g. workâ€“life balance policy.</p>
			<p>In political science, the policy cycle is a tool used for the
				analyzing of the development of a policy item. It can also be
				referred to as a "stagist approach", "stages heuristic" or "stages
				approach".</p>
			<p>It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of
				how policy is created, but has been influential in how political
				scientists looked at policy in general.[3] It was developed as a
				theory from Harold Lasswell's work.</div>
